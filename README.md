# Overview #
A To Do List Board application that can be deployed on a local Express.js server.
The application allows users to create multiple to do lists, each with a title and a set of tasks, and displays all of them similar to a kanban board.
A PostgreSQL database is used to store each list and it's associated task.

# Future Improvements/Ideas #
- Add an optional "Date" field to each task or list
- Add an optinal "Importance" field to each task or list
- Add interactivity to each list, e.g. allow users to drag and drop lists on the screen or drag a task from one list to the other.
